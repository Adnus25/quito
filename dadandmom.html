		<p>Dad and Mom met in college, where they were both studying . They were introduced to each other by a mutual friend, and they hit it off right away. Dad was struck by Mom's intelligence and beauty, while Mom was drawn to Dad's sense of humor and charm.</p>
		<p>They started dating soon after and quickly became inseparable.they got busy but they always made time for each other.</p>
		<p>After a few years of dating, Dad proposed to Mom on a beautiful beach in Hawaii, and she said yes. They got married a year later and have been happily married ever since.</p>
		<p>Their love story is an inspiration to me and reminds me that true love really does exist. I am grateful every day to have them as my parents.</p>
